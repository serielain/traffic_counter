# traffic_counter

PROBLEM WITH MOTORCYCLES CURRENTLY :(

This program is a traffic counter. It counts objects that cross the line_point specified in the main.py.

All parameters that need to be specified by the user are at the top of the main.py file (below the imports).

The classes are tracked class wise and combined.

A video timelapse of every 30th frame with 10fps and 50% source quality is also made, if needed, you get asked when closing (with CTRL+C) the program.
Also 2 graphs are created, tracking traffic objects, combined and not combined but compared to each other, over time.
